🫀 Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning.


Hi there! I'm Anushka and Discussed and brainstormed with [@AbhishekkPatilll](https://github.com/AbhishekkPatilll) this is one of our ML-powered health-focused projects where we predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. 💻

📌 About the Project
This project aims to build a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of a person developing heart disease based on medical attributes. It showcases end-to-end implementation from data preprocessing to model evaluation, all built with care and code.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of medical data for improved model accuracy

Implementation of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)

Performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall & F1 score

Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook for learning & exploration

🔧 Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Colab, Git

📊 Sample Visuals

💡 What I Learned

The importance of feature selection and data balancing

Model evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy

How to make healthcare predictions responsibly

🧠 Future Scope

Implement ensemble models like Random Forest or XGBoost

Add a simple Flask app for web-based prediction

Include explainability with SHAP values or LIME
